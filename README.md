# YADSFiveM
Yet Another Death Script for FiveM.







# Installation
Although getting it to work couldn't be easier here you go.
Firts drop YADS (the file inside, not the master branch),
then start the resource in your server.cfg

```lua
start mapmanager
start chat
start spawnmanager
start sessionmanager
start fivem
start hardcap
start rconlog
start scoreboard
start playernames
start RPdeath
```
Woho, you are done. It should work now!
